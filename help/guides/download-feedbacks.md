# **How to download feedbacks and metadata**

To download raw customer feedback data or metadata, follow these steps

1. Click on "Search" from the left-hand navigation panel.

2. Click on "Select Entity" to choose the product, brand, service, user group, etc. for which you want to download feedback data.

3. You have several options to filter the data before downloading:

   - Apply various filters such as date range, channel, etc., to narrow down the feedback data.

   - If you're looking for specific feedback, enter a search term in the search bar to filter the results accordingly.

   - Use the Sort dropdown menu to sort the feedback data by sentiment, recency, or popularity.

   - Select the "All" tab if you want to download all available data.

   - Select the respective Sentiment tab (Positive/Negative/Neutral) to download by sentiment.

4. Once you've applied your desired filters and sorted the data, click the "Export" button to export as CSV.

The download will contain both the customer feedback text as well as the metadata about the feedback, such as date, author, channel, etc.

Note: Up to 10,000 entries can be downloaded per CSV. For larger datasets, use date range filters to download in batches.
