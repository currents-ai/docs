# Teams

The goal with 'Teams' is to segregate different functional units in an organization e.g Marketing, Product, Support, etc and differentiate what each team sees. 
For e.g, bookmarks can be created for an individual, or specific teams or the whole company. We're rolling out similar permissions next week for Reports as well. We're developing more visibility/control features on top of 'Teams' - happy to prioritize any controls that you might need.

[Admins and Owners](/roles) can create teams on FreeText AI to organize access to various resources such as reports, bookmarks, etc.

Follow the steps below to create teams.

### Go to Manage > Teams


### Click on 'Create Team'
