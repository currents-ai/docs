# Create a Team

'Teams' can be used to segregate different functional units in an organization e.g Marketing, Product, Support, etc. 
 
[Admins and Owners](/roles) can create teams on FreeText AI to organize access to various resources such as reports, bookmarks, etc.

For e.g, 'Bookmarks' can be created for an individual, or specific teams or the whole company. 

Similarly, the visibility for 'Reports' can also be controlled for different teams.
