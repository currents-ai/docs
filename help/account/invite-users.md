# Invite Users

You can invite other users from your organization to FreeText AI, as long as you're an [admin](/roles) or [owner](/roles).

Below are steps to follow - 

### Go to Manage > Users

You'll see the list of all users, those who have been invited or those that have already joined, as well as their roles in the platform.
