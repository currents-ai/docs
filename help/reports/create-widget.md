# Create a Widget

After you've created a new report, you can start adding widgets to the report.

Here's a guide on how to create widgets.

## 1. Click on "Add Widget"

Click on the "Add Widget" button in the center of the page. This will open a modal with all the existing widgets that can be added to the report.

## 2. Create New Widget 

If you'd like to create a new widget, click on "Create New Widget" button. 
(Or you can add widgets from the existing list of widgets available.)

Clicking on the "Create New Widget" button will take you to the widget builder page.

### 3b. Select 'Data Source'

Next, select the data source for the widget from the list of sources that you've added.

:::note
If you're building an [instance report](/reports), the data source will be saved with the widget.

If you're building a [template](/reports), the data source will not be saved (since the template can be used with any data source).

### 3c. Apply Filters

From the filters section, apply relevant filters. For e.g if you're visualizing 'top negative sentiment drivers', you may want to filter for 'negative sentiment'.

### 3d. Widget Name

Give the widget a unique, descriptive name.

### 3e. Metrics & Dimensions

Once you've picked data sources and applied filters, you need to pick the metrics and dimensions to create the visualization.

| Type | Definition | Examples |
| ---- | ---------- | -------  |
| Metrics | Metrics are numerical measurements that represent different aspects of business. They provide specific data points like sales revenue, website traffic, customer satisfaction scores, or inventory levels. | Visits, Rating, Sentiment Score, etc |
| Dimensions | Dimensions are characteristics that add context to your metrics. They help categorize and group data for analysis. Dimensions can be time (dates or months), geographical location, product categories, customer segments, or marketing channels. | Country, City, Gender, etc |

Once these details are provided, the visualization should show up. Continue to iterate or click "Save" to add the widget to the dashboard.
