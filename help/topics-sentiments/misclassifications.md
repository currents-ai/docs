# How to fix Topic-Sentiment Misclassifications

Sometimes, the AI may incorrectly classify aspects of feedback. This guide explains how to manually edit and correct any misclassifications.

To edit topic-sentiment misclassifications:
- Click on the feedback you want to edit to open the feedback modal.
- Click the edit icon to open the topic-sentiment selection dropdown.Â 
- In this dropdown, you can deselect any incorrectly assigned topics-sentiment that are not relevant to the feedback text. You can also search for and select any missing topics-sentiment that should be associated with the feedback based on its content.
- Save your changes after adding/removing the appropriate topics.
- Refresh the page to see the updated topic-sentiment classifications for that feedback.
