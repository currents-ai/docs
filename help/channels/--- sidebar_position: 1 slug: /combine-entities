## Creating a New Data Source by Combining Entities

This guide explains how to create a new data source by combining entities that are already available in the FreeText.ai platform.

### Prerequisites

*   You should be logged into your FreeText.ai dashboard.
*   You should have already created/uploaded entities within your account.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

    *   From the main dashboard, look for the "Manage" icon or menu item (often found in the left-hand navigation bar).
    *   Click on "Manage."

3.  **Configure Basic Data Source Details:**

    *   **Category:** Select the appropriate category for the new data source. (leave as-is if there is only one category)

    *   **Name:**  Enter a descriptive name for the new data source. This name should clearly indicate the purpose or content of the data source.

4.  **Add Existing Entities as Sources:**

    *   In the modal that appears, you will be given three options. Select "Existing Data Sources" to add entities that are already present in the system.

    *   **Locate the Entities You Want to Combine:**
        *   Use the search bar, filters, or scroll through the list of available entities to find the ones you want to include in the new data source.

        *   **Search:** You can type the entity name in the search bar to find a specific entity.
    *   **Select the Entities:**
        *   Check the box next to each entity that you want to add to the new data source.
        *   You can select multiple entities to combine them into a single data source.

        *   Select "Done" to add them to the sources.
