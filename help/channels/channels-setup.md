## Request Channel

If you need a channel that's not listed or is not enabled for your account, drop an email to help@freetext.ai or **[contact here](https://freetext.ai/contact)**.


## Data Sources 

Once your channel is added and data sources are configured, the platform will schedule a task to sync and process data.

You can monitor task progress under **Manage > Data Sources**.
