# Sentiment Score (Percent)

A Sentiment Score is a cumulative metric that encapsulates the overall emotional resonance of customer feedback. It considers all relevant customer feedback, calculating an aggregate score that reflects the prevailing sentiment—be it positive, negative, or neutral—amongst a customer base.

The score ranges from 0% to 100%.

- 0% - 40%: Predominantly Negative Sentiment
- 41% - 60%: Mixed or Neutral Sentiment
- 61% - 100%: Predominantly Positive Sentiment


## Why is Sentiment Score Useful?

Sentiment Score allows brands and businesses to gauge the prevailing customer sentiment around their products, services, or campaigns. 

- **Single, Holistic Metric**: Sentiment score is a comprehensive metric that represents the totality of customer sentiment, thereby simplifying the complexity of navigating through myriad individual feedback and responses.

- **Indicator of Sentiment Trends**: By observing the Sentiment Score over time, brands can detect trends in changing consumer emotions and perceptions, enabling them to adjust strategies and maintain alignment with customer expectations.

- **Spotting Red Flags**: Notable dips or fluctuations in the Sentiment Score serve as red flags, prompting brands to delve deeper into customer feedback and interactions to identify potential issues or areas of discontent before they escalate into more substantial challenges.

- **Targeted Improvement Strategies**: Periodic evaluations of Sentiment Score enable brands to devise and implement targeted improvement and enhancement strategies, ensuring that efforts are specifically oriented towards areas that will most positively impact customer sentiment.


## How is Sentiment Score Calculated?

The Sentiment Score is calculated using the following formula:

**Sentiment Score = ((pos count − neg count) / (pos count + neg count + neu count))**

Where:

pos count = Number of positive mentions or feedback.
<br/>neg count = Number of negative mentions or feedback.
<br/>neu count = Number of neutral mentions or feedback.

The Sentiment Score ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 represents the most negative sentiment, 0 represents neutral sentiment, and 1 represents the most positive sentiment.

To normalize the Sentiment Score to a 0 - 100% scale for easier comprehension, we use the following formula:

**Sentiment Score Percentage = (Sentiment Score + 1) / 2 × 100%**

## How to Interpret the Sentiment Score?

The Sentiment Score can be interpreted as follows:

- **0% - 40%**: Predominantly Negative Sentiment – Customer feedback tends to be more negative and indicates potential issues that require attention.

- **41% - 60%**: Mixed or Neutral Sentiment – Customer feedback is mixed or neutral, showcasing neither strong positive nor negative emotions towards the brand.

- **61% - 100%**: Predominantly Positive Sentiment – Customers express more positive feedback, indicating satisfaction and positive experiences with the brand.

It's crucial to note that while a high sentiment score is desirable, fluctuating or consistently neutral scores might warrant further investigation into the specifics of customer feedback to uncover latent issues or opportunities.
