# User Roles - Members, Admins, Owners

Currently, the platform supports three different user roles -
1. Members
2. Admins
3. Owners

Owners have the highest level of control over the platform, followed by Admins and Members. Typically, the user who created the account is assigned as the "owner". The owner can invite other teammates  as "Member" or "Admin" by using the "Invite Users" feature in the platform.

Below is a table that enumerates the access control capabilities as it stands today -
